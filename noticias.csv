They rallied a majority of their colleagues in the House to vote against funding a program to train and equip Ukrainian troops.

The story of Mr. McCarthy’s relentless rise is well-known and often repeated in his hometown. He was first and foremost a nice local guy, born and raised in Bakersfield, where he also attended college. Around that time, he opened a small deli in a corner of a frozen yogurt shop owned by his aunt and uncle. (Whether this experience earned him the right to describe himself forever after as a small business entrepreneur is a matter of some discussion.)

The front-runner for the Republican nomination, Donald J.

But the steel mills and coal mines failed to roar back to their glory days, and the internal-combustion engine is unlikely to as well. In fact, the electric vehicle transition is well underway.

That transition is driven in part by President Biden’s policies, which subsidize the manufacturing and purchasing of E.V.s and their components and impose strict fuel economy standards on automakers that can be met with zero-emission electric cars. But it’s also motivated by Detroit executives who have vowed to convert their corporations to all electric, by consumers reacting to environmental concerns and gas prices, and by aggressive policies from governments like those of California, Britain and Europe that are beyond the reach of a Republican White House.","wont,cars,stop,gop,steel,electric,transition,vehicles,trump,mr,republican,ramaswamy,rest,bashing,promised",0.11401,-0.03768,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/us/politics/05pol-electricvehicles/05pol-electricvehicles-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/14/reader-center/author-anjali-huynh/author-anjali-huynh-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/author-jonathan-weisman/author-jonathan-weisman-thumbLarge-v2.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/us/politics/05pol-electricvehicles/05pol-electricvehicles-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/us/politics/05pol-electricvehicles/05pol-electricvehicles-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}"

A hard-R spin on “The Parent Trap” that Jackson and Sharp based on a play they used to perform in the basement of a Gristedes, their film casts the New York comedians as long-lost twins who conspire to reunite their daffy parents. Hayley Mills never had it so hard, though: Here, dear old Mom (Megan Mullally) is an eccentric shut-in with a detached vagina, while Dad (Lane) is a newly out bon vivant who’s uncomfortably devoted to the two disgusting sewer creatures he keeps caged in his living room.

“When I read it, I said to my agent and manager, ‘Are you serious with this?’” Lane recalled. The script had made him laugh, but he worried the comic situations were too outrageous, even for him.

“It went on for four hours, and I fell in love with them and wanted to adopt them,” said Lane, who was ultimately won over by the eagerness of Jackson and Sharp to fly in the face of decorum at a time when “Don’t Say Gay” bills were being written into law. “We’re going to say whatever we want,” Lane said, channeling the duo’s brio. “And you’ll have to live with it.”

Still, it’s one thing to read those out-there scenes and quite another to actually perform them, as Lane found when he showed up on set.

Unfortunately, the country at the very top of our bucket list has an authoritarian government and a poor human rights record. We’re finding it difficult to evaluate the cost/benefit of our possible travel there. Our tourism dollars would directly support the local tourism industry and the people who rely on it for their livelihoods. But we’re concerned that it would indirectly support the regime in power, as well. How do we evaluate the ethical implications? — Laura R.

From the Ethicist:

The case against visiting isn’t so much that you’re actually going to be prolonging a bad regime (any effect would be microscopic); rather, it’s that there’s something inherently regrettable about contributing to the welfare of wrongdoers. Weighing in favor of your trip, as you say, is your direct support of the people in the tourism trade who will earn your dollars. The countries with the poorest human rights records typically deny their citizens both freedom of the press and effective democratic participation, and this makes it unreasonable to hold those citizens responsible for what their governments do; in rewarding them, you’re not rewarding those responsible for the state’s repressive ways.

If these were the only relevant issues, the case for going would be clearly much stronger than the case for staying away. Most of the other ethically relevant issues weigh in favor of going, too. You will benefit yourselves, not only by being enriched by an unfamiliar culture and experiencing new places and ways of life but also by deepening your familiarity with the wrongs perpetrated by the government. This, in turn, will give you both the incentive and the knowledge to engage with others about the issue.

But suppose there were currently a boycott in place that had support from credible representatives of the people of that country and was having, or was likely to have, positive effects in improving conditions there. If that were the case, you should honor the boycott. It can be good to participate in a political process even when — as with voting — your personal contribution has a minuscule effect on the outcome.","rewarding,human,youre,relevant,case,record,going,rights,poor,responsible,destination,regime,tourism,support,vacation",0.42289,0.05889,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/08/magazine/08mag-ethicist-online/08mag-ethicist-online-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/08/magazine/08mag-ethicist-online/08mag-ethicist-online-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/08/magazine/08mag-ethicist-online/08mag-ethicist-online-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/14/reader-center/author-kwame-anthony-appiah/author-kwame-anthony-appiah-thumbLarge.png'}"

But rates of S.T.I.s are highest among Black people and Native Americans, who are often those with the least access to health care.
Evidence so far supports doxy-PEP’s use only in men who have sex with men and in transgender women.
In those groups, the antibiotic cut rates of syphilis and chlamydia by about 90 percent and gonorrhea by about 55 percent.
Men who have sex with men account for nearly half of reported syphilis cases, according to the C.D.C.","Why It Matters: Rates of S.T.I.s are skyrocketing.

In 2021, there were 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, more than 700,000 cases of gonorrhea and nearly 177,000 cases of syphilis in the United States, together tallying up to $1.1 billion in direct medical costs. (Rates of babies born with syphilis also soared that year, with nearly 3,000 affected.)

All three S.T.I.s are caused by bacteria and are easily treated with antibiotics. But the closure of sexual health clinics across the country and a drop in public awareness has contributed to a sharp rise in infections.

Gonorrhea cases have increased 118 percent since a historical low in 2009, according to the C.D.C. Syphilis was nearly eliminated in the United States about 20 years ago, but cases have risen 74 percent since 2017.

On any given day in 2018, about one in five Americans had an S.T.I., the C.D.C. has estimated.

“We need game-changing innovations to turn the S.T.I. epidemic around, and this is a major step in the right direction,” Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the agency’s National Center for H.I.V., Viral Hepatitis, S.T.D. and TB Prevention, said in an emailed statement.

Background: Doxycycline is a powerful deterrent of infection.

The C.D.C.’s guidelines are based on studies that show that a single dose of doxycycline taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex dramatically cuts the risk of the infections.

Evidence from emerging research was compelling enough that clinics in some cities, such as San Francisco, have been offering doxy-PEP to those at high risk of infection for months. Generally, patients are given a supply of pills and told to take one within three days of an encounter during which they might have become infected.

But rates of S.T.I.s are highest among Black people and Native Americans, who are often those with the least access to health care. “No prevention tool — no matter how powerful — will change the S.T.I. epidemic if it doesn’t reach the people who need it most,” Dr. Mermin said.

What Critics Say: Wider antibiotic use may pose risks.

Doxycycline has been in use for decades, and there are few indications that bacteria have become resistant to it. Syphilis and chlamydia do not often develop resistance, but gonorrhea is another question: Those bacteria have become resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics.

Still, the picture may change depending on how many people take doxy-PEP and how often, some experts cautioned.

“At the population level, that does worry me,” said Antón Castellanos Usigli, a sexual health expert who is an adjunct lecturer at the Columbia Mailman School of Health.

In places like his native Mexico, Dr. Castellanos Usigli said, indiscriminate use of antibiotics has fueled the rise of drug-resistant bacteria and can also alter a person’s gut microbiome.

What Happens Next: The C.D.C. will finalize new guidelines.

Evidence so far supports doxy-PEP’s use only in men who have sex with men and in transgender women. In those groups, the antibiotic cut rates of syphilis and chlamydia by about 90 percent and gonorrhea by about 55 percent.

Men who have sex with men account for nearly half of reported syphilis cases, according to the C.D.C. If studies show the approach to be effective in heterosexual cisgender men and cisgender women, the guidelines may be expanded.

The agency said doctors should prescribe doxy-PEP as part of a comprehensive sexual health program that includes counseling, screening and treatment for the infections and for H.I.V.

“Doxy-PEP will be a good option for some patients,” Dr. Castellanos Usigli said. “But we will have to do a lot of education with medical providers and patients so that we target the best candidates and prevent misuse and overuse.”","prevent,cases,syphilis,men,dr,sex,cdc,way,stis,pill,rates,health,bacteria,usigli,nearly",0.37179,0.14988,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/03/multimedia/03doxy-mlcg/03doxy-mlcg-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/03/multimedia/03doxy-mlcg/03doxy-mlcg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/07/reader-center/author-apoorva-mandavilli/author-apoorva-mandavilli-thumbLarge-v5.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/03/multimedia/03doxy-mlcg/03doxy-mlcg-facebookJumbo.jpg'}"

“When you think of Los Angeles, most people think, ‘Oh, highways and traffic,’ but it has these darling neighborhoods,” Ms. Banker said.","Dawn and Gary Banker loved living in their floating home in Portland, Ore. Surrounded by two dozen houses on a residential pier in the Columbia River, they would step onto their deck and take in the views of Hayden Island as the water lapped at their porch.

But each winter, the couple, who are retired scientists, wilted under the city’s ever-gray skies. And they missed their two adult children, who lived nearly 1,000 miles away, in Los Angeles. Around a decade ago, the Bankers began spending more time there to be with family and escape the cold.

“As time went by, that month kind of became six weeks, became two months,” said Mr. Banker, 77. Finally, last year, they rented a one-bedroom apartment in the east side neighborhood of Echo Park. But “it never really occurred to us that we might move.”

Out of curiosity, the Bankers began casually visiting open houses in the area. At first, they considered buying a second home, but quickly realized they couldn’t afford it.

“It was a little bit terrifying, especially seeing things close in a few days for $100,000 or $200,000 more” than the asking price, said Ms. Banker, 70. But earlier this year, when a friend expressed interest in the floating house, the Bankers took it as a sign and decided to sell.

After the parties reached an agreement for the house and the slip on the river, settling at $737,000, the Los Angeles hunt kicked into high gear. To be close to their children, as well as to shopping and restaurants, their goal was to stay on the city’s east side.

“When you think of Los Angeles, most people think, ‘Oh, highways and traffic,’ but it has these darling neighborhoods,” Ms. Banker said. The couple, both bird-watchers, were also drawn to the area for its parks.

They wanted an open, light-filled space with a good kitchen (they love to cook), some outdoor space with room for a garden, and a guest room for out-of-state friends. Extra space for their hobbies — bookbinding and ceramics — would be a bonus. Combining the proceeds from the house sale, their savings and a loan, the Bankers amassed a budget of around $1.7 million.

A friend from Portland put them in touch with his sister, Maura Barraza, an agent with Pinnacle Estate Properties. When she met the Bankers, Ms. Barraza thought, “Oh, no, they’re in for a huge shock.”

Properties were moving fast, and there was low inventory, she said: “The market was very strong.”

21,New York Times,periodico,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/opinion/ibram-x-kendi-racism.html,Portada del dia,Opinion | ‘Antiracism’ Was Never the Right Answer,"{""Pamela Paul""}",2023-10-05,"“The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination,” Kendi wrote, in words that would be softened in a future edition after they became the subject of criticism.
The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.” In other words, two wrongs do make a right.
Among the book’s central tenets is that everyone must choose between his approach, which he called “antiracism,” and racism itself.
Kendi’s antiracism prescription meant that universities, corporations and nonprofits would need to remove all policies that weren’t overtly antiracist.

The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.” In other words, two wrongs do make a right. As practiced, that meant curriculums that favor works by Black people over white people are one way to achieve that goal; hiring quotas are another.

Among the book’s central tenets is that everyone must choose between his approach, which he called “antiracism,” and racism itself. It would no longer be enough for an individual or organization to simply be “not racist,” which Kendi called a “mask for racism” — they must instead be actively “antiracist,” applying a strict lens of racism to their every thought and action, and in fields wholly unrelated to race, in order to escape deliberate or inadvertent racist thinking and behavior. “What we say about race, what we do about race, in each moment, determines what — not who — we are,” Kendi wrote.

Kendi’s antiracism prescription meant that universities, corporations and nonprofits would need to remove all policies that weren’t overtly antiracist. In the Boston University English department’s playwriting M.F.A. program, for example, reading assignments had to come from “50 percent diverse-identifying and marginalized writers,” and writers of “white or Eurocentric lineage” had to be taught through “an actively antiracist lens.” Antiracism also requires a commitment to other positions, including active opposition to sexism, homophobia, colorism, ethnocentrism, nativism, cultural prejudice and any class biases that supposedly harm Black lives. To deviate from any of this is to be racist. Either you’re with us or you’re against us.

Yet, as the psychologist and author Jonathan Haidt pointed out, Kendi’s dichotomy is “incorrect from a social-science perspective because there are obviously many other remedies,” including ones that address social, economic and cultural disparities through a fairer distribution of resources.

When a Minneapolis police officer murdered Floyd in May 2020, Kendi’s book, with its propitious, here-is-what-you-must-do-now title, became the bible for anyone newly committed to the cause of racial justice. Schools and companies made it required reading. So many campuses made it their class read, all-school read or community read that the publisher created a full set of reading and teaching guides for them. (Employees at the publishing house, Penguin Random House, were told to read it as the first “true companywide read” to begin “antiracism training mandatory for all employees.”) Universities used Kendi’s antiracist framework as the basis by which applicants’ required diversity statements would be judged.","kendis,racism,opinion,antiracism,right,answer,race,read,racist,remedy,reading,antiracist,discrimination",0.24951,0.02725,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/06/opinion/05paul-image/05paul-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/06/opinion/05paul-image/05paul-image-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/06/opinion/05paul-image/05paul-image-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}"

It takes way more work to hold a student accountable than to simply pass him/her.
Even if a kid does nothing all year, we are encouraged to find a way to pass him/her.","A few weeks ago, I wrote about how America’s teacher pipeline is drying up. According to education researchers, the proportion of college graduates who go into teaching is at a 50-year low. Yes, there are still college graduates and young professionals willing to commit to a challenging career that frequently comes with low pay, but that pool shrinks when you factor in mountainous student debt, declining respect for teachers and the reality that schools are ground zero for the culture wars.

I included a questionnaire at the end of that newsletter, asking teachers and parents what they think has changed about teaching and the perception of the job in their communities. I mostly heard back from teachers, and one of their consistent themes was that they felt they could no longer hold students accountable academically or behaviorally because of pressure from snowplow parents and bad district policies.

The current teachers quoted in this newsletter asked not to go on the record with their full names in order to avoid potential repercussions in their workplaces. A typical response came from Russell, a public high school teacher on the East Coast. He said that when a big chunk of the graduating class “has a 4.0, grades are meaningless,” adding:

Failure is a bad word — and the kids know it. It takes way more work to hold a student accountable than to simply pass him/her. Even if a kid does nothing all year, we are encouraged to find a way to pass him/her. And then, of course, when a student does not perform, parents often want to know what we are going to do about it — not what their child can do.

Part of the issue is grade inflation. As Chalkbeat reported last year, “Even as students have taken higher-level courses, their G.P.A.s have steadily risen — from an average of 2.68 in 1990 to 2.94 in 2000, 3.0 in 2009 and 3.11 in 2019.” At the same time, test scores on national exams have dropped or remained unchanged, which suggests that students aren’t actually better prepared in math, English or science than they were 20 years ago. The lack of basic skills has been evident for a while: Many two- and four-year colleges devote significant resources to remedial education.

This overall state of play has become more alarming since 2020, given how far behind schoolchildren are now. What’s not helping? The policies many school districts are adopting that make it nearly impossible for low-performing students to fail — they have a grading floor under them, they know it, and that allows them to game the system.","student,pass,miserable,school,accountable,opinion,know,teacher,way,hold,students,teachers,teaching,job,making,cant,parents",0.29889,0.00638,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/opinion/04grose-newsletter-image/04grose-newsletter-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/opinion/04grose-newsletter-image/04grose-newsletter-image-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/opinion/04grose-newsletter-image/04grose-newsletter-image-facebookJumbo.jpg'}"

When it held itself up as a model of a stable, predictable democracy. When it sent idealistic young avatars to distant parts of the globe to impart the American way.

These days, to many watching at home and abroad, the American way no longer seems to offer a case study in effective representative democracy. Instead, it has become an example of disarray and discord, one that rewards extremism, challenges norms and threatens to divide a polarized country even further.

The Republican uprising that led to the ouster of a House speaker for the first time in American history would be enough of a disruption. But the upheaval on Capitol Hill comes as a former president sits in a New York courtroom, already judged to be a fraud, while using increasingly violent language and pushing the limits of a gag order. At the same time, military aid to stop Russian invaders in Ukraine has been held up by a vocal G.O.P. minority in Congress, and another government shutdown looms next month.

The institutions that were already strained during Donald J. Trump’s presidency now face a series of profound stress tests. Can the courts maintain public faith and deal credibly with a former president running for his old job who has been accused of so many crimes it is hard to keep track? Can Congress get its act together enough to simply pick a leader, much less address vexing issues like immigration, spending, climate change and gun violence?

JaJuan died 17 minutes later.”

Children are generally medically healthy, which is why accidental injuries pose the greatest threat to their lives. Car accidents have long accounted for the bulk of injury-related fatalities among children.","pulled,visiting,study,tshirtjajuan,finds,mcdowell,loaded,wasnt,gun,children,teenager,lives,jajuan,rising,deaths,sharply",0.30972,0.14861,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/science/05guns/05guns-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-roni-caryn-rabin/author-roni-caryn-rabin-thumbLarge-v3.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/science/05guns/05guns-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/science/05guns/05guns-facebookJumbo.jpg'}"

The strike continued on Thursday in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington State, so patients in those states could be affected.

Kaiser, whose health plans cover nearly 13 million people through a network of hospitals and clinics, says its hospitals, emergency departments and urgent care centers remain open. But patients should expect delays in scheduling appointments, and procedures that are not considered urgent could be postponed. Doctors and many nurses are not on strike. Kaiser said it would make time available for surgeries in the coming weeks to reschedule any procedures delayed as a result of the strike.

What services are affected?

Many of Kaiser’s labs in California were closed because of the strike, so some tests and results will likely be delayed. An array of other services, like imaging and the filling of prescriptions, could be delayed because of the walkouts. Some clinics and pharmacies could be closed, and Kaiser said it would contact patients with any cancellations.

Kaiser’s hospitals are open. But some people seeking care could be directed to a hospital outside of Kaiser’s usual network if their doctors thought it was necessary. Kaiser’s hospital-based pharmacies also remain open, though the health system is urging people to use its mail order pharmacy if they can wait. Some patients may also be able to go to an outside retail pharmacy to fill a prescription.","open,permanente,patients,strike,kaiser,hospitals,remain,delayed,kaisers,urgent,services,means",0.29494,0.07321,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/multimedia/04KAISER-STRIKE-EXPLAINER-lmgw/04KAISER-STRIKE-EXPLAINER-lmgw-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/multimedia/04KAISER-STRIKE-EXPLAINER-lmgw/04KAISER-STRIKE-EXPLAINER-lmgw-threeByTwoLargeAt2X.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/multimedia/04KAISER-STRIKE-EXPLAINER-lmgw/04KAISER-STRIKE-EXPLAINER-lmgw-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/16/multimedia/author-reed-abelson/author-reed-abelson-thumbLarge.png'}"

They then took the insects to a makeshift lab in their hotel suite in the island’s one town, Santo Antonio, where they slid them under the light of a fluorescent microscope.

The recaptured green mosquitoes offered insight into how far they flew and the size of the mosquito population, clues to the dynamics of malaria in this country.

Their idea is to release a small colony of genetically modified mosquitoes, just the way they did with the green-dusted ones, to mate with wild ones. The gene engineering technology they are using could, in just a few generations — a matter of months when it comes to mosquitoes — make every member of the species that transmits malaria here, the Anopheles coluzzii, effectively immune to the parasite.

This team, working with a project called the University of California Malaria Initiative, has already successfully engineered the Anopheles coluzzii to block the parasite in a lab. And the scientists believe they can harness gene drive, a process in which an inherited trait spreads swiftly throughout a population, so that all the species’s offspring will carry it, not just half, which is the way inheritance normally works.","ones,modified,genetically,gamble,disease,way,scientists,release,mosquito,mosquitoes,end,population,lab,malaria",0.51759,0.12811,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/03/multimedia/XX-mosquitos-genetics-copy/XX-mosquitos-genetics-vfzj-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/04/science/sci-tanzania-split/sci-tanzania-split-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/28/multimedia/xx-PROMO-mosquitoes-new-solutions-tklc/xx-PROMO-mosquitoes-new-solutions-tklc-thumbLarge.jpg', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw==', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/10/multimedia/xx-mosquitoes-overview-promo/xx-mosquitoes-overview-promo-thumbLarge.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/03/multimedia/XX-mosquitos-genetics-copy/XX-mosquitos-genetics-vfzj-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/11/multimedia/XX-mosquitos-genetics-vfzj/XX-mosquitos-genetics-vfzj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/29/science/mosquitoes-wolbachia-disease-viruses-1695763855427/mosquitoes-wolbachia-disease-viruses-1695763855427-thumbLarge.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/11/multimedia/XX-mosquitos-genetics-copy/XX-mosquitos-genetics-vfzj-thumbLarge.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/03/multimedia/XX-mosquitos-genetics-02-mwpj/XX-mosquitos-genetics-02-mwpj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/26/multimedia/xx-mosquitoes-stephensi-promo/xx-mosquitoes-stephensi-01-bpwv-thumbLarge.jpg'}"

“He is using more forceful rhetoric than any U.A.W. leadership in a long while, reaching back to the 1930s and 1940s,” Mr. Lichtenstein said. “The idea of mutual accommodation with the companies is gone.”

Mr. Fain took Senator Bernie Sanders, the progressive Vermont independent, to a September rally and cites Walter Reuther, the U.A.W. leader during the postwar years, as an inspiration, along with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the “pyramid of success” developed by John Wooden, the coach who produced a U.C.L.A. basketball dynasty. The Wooden principles include at the apex a suggestion about “enjoyment of a difficult challenge.”

A strike is a double-edged sword, said Patrick Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing, Mich. The greater the number of striking workers, the more pressure on the employer. But as the strike goes on, the people who will feel it the worst are those very workers, which gives them an incentive to settle. The automakers know this, of course, which makes for a difficult challenge indeed.

Alto’s growth, along with other fledgling ride-hailing businesses like Revel’s employee-driven Teslas in New York City, could show there are viable alternatives.

“If Alto succeeds, there will be substantial pressure on Uber and Lyft to change to an employment model, because Alto will have proven the concept,” said Seth Harris, a law and policy professor at Northeastern University and former labor adviser to President Biden. Uber has turned to a similar model in other parts of the world when required to do so, contracting with fleets that employ drivers in countries like Spain.

But it’s too early to say whether Alto can succeed at a scale that challenges the dominant model. It’s an expensive service, and it has struggled recently.

In July, Alto pulled out of the San Francisco Bay Area, just a year after beginning to offer rides there — a decision that Mr. Coleman attributed to San Francisco’s not yet returning to prepandemic levels of commuting. The company laid off several dozen corporate employees in August, and has delayed plans to expand into new cities to focus on growth in its current markets: Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington.

Whether Alto’s approach is truly a better deal for drivers is also up for debate. Its driver pay, which varies by city, is not especially high.

It is simple enough to argue that the most direct path is the best one, but humanity doesn’t really work like that. As a species, we learn by doing — and often enough, we find joy in it. Taking the time to master a skill, to understand a process or to have a conversation — even if it isn’t quite as fast — is consistently more rewarding than having something simply done for you. Efficiency-focused single-mindedness might make things faster, but it is a thief of life’s joys.

If the point of all this — state, trade, industry, culture, society writ large — is well-being and joy, making lives better, then, as often as may be, it should work on a human scale, embracing the winding trails of life over the direct highway bulldozed through the mountainside. That’s not to say there is no place for efficiency, but to govern people, who are by nature not particularly efficient, with too heavy a bias toward simply getting things done is doubtless a well-intentioned mistake. Our government should be as strange as we are, more or less.

If the state exists to improve the lives of the governed, and the lives of the governed are bettered not by robotic, quasi-fascistic insistence on efficiency über alles, then the state, too, must embrace a more laid-back style. There’s no need to establish a Department of Capriciousness or a National Whimsy Agency; indeed, either would only strive far too efficiently to establish inefficiency. Rather, we can make little tweaks. Eliminating the decimalization of currencies would be a start. Bringing back cavalry cuirasses and epaulets in the military would be a fitting second step. Perhaps the Department of Education could encourage unique scholastic scarves and oddball traditions at every institution that receives its funding.

Of course, this isn’t likely. The nature of business and government is to prize efficiency, to value cost saving and corner cutting and results-focused thinking (or whatever the consultants call it). But even outside of the sheer joy of taking a moment longer to perform a task — to take a longer trip home because you’d rather see the sun set over the bridge, to set the vinyl record carefully on the turntable instead, to visit your local takeout place and chat with the cashier in lieu of punching an order for 47 dumplings into an app — there is a beauty and (dare I say it) usefulness to inefficiency.

Inefficiency is generative; inefficiency is where we source our ideas, our inspirations, our conceptions of a world of endless paths and journeys rather than one of monotonous drudgery occupied only in repetitive labor. A life whimsically lived, a society whimsically (dis)ordered, is one that promotes freedom of thought, even as it knows many of the freely found thoughts won’t be all that useful.","york,whimsy,things,whimsically,taking,society,thief,state,work,times,joy,lives,efficiency",0.45681,0.06981,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/autossell/05Richards-Promo/05Richards-Promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/autossell/05Richards-Promo/05Richards-Promo-square640.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/autossell/05Richards-Promo/05Richards-Promo-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/22/opinion/parker-richards/parker-richards-thumbLarge.png'}"

You could hear the disappointment in the groans from A’s and Ohtani fans alike.","Baseball is a game of turns, not time. It argues for a different metaphysics (“catching rhythms,” Quincy Troupe calls it, or as Gail Mazur puts it, a “firm structure with the mystery / of accidents”) that absconds from our universe of time, even if only for the duration of an illusion on a summer afternoon. With the new rules and particularly the new pitch clock, the game has become one less place in our subdivided lives in which we get to imagine — to feel, to daydream — something existing outside of time.

Even the theater of the performed four-pitch intentional walk had an idiosyncrasy about it so true to baseball, and to being human. It was a modest digression in the course of an inning, a silly little dance. It was interesting to see if the batter would take a wild swing at one or if the pitcher would go lazy and throw a comically wild pitch or — more beautiful and rare — if he’d catch the batter sleeping and sneak a zinging, disorienting strike down the middle of the plate. The whole affair would add a minute or two to a game.

The pitch clock is the biggest modification to the game in years: With nobody on base, pitchers have 15 seconds to wind up and throw. With a runner on, the pitcher has 20 seconds. If pitcher or batter is not ready by the appointed second, the penalty is a ball or strike, depending on which side is getting penalized.

One pitch clock incident this summer stands out to me. There’s no better baseball weather in the world than Oakland in September. We were in the top half of the eighth, the A’s beating the Angels 6-0, when Shohei Ohtani, a rare star at both pitching and hitting, stepped to the plate. It felt as if there were more Ohtani fans in the stands than A’s fans.

On this night we’d arrived at his last trip to the plate, and excitement swept through the crowd. The count went to 3-2. Two out, nothing on the line, since it was a rout, but still, fans got on their feet. The pitcher stared home. And how did this minor showdown end? With a clock violation by the pitcher, awarding Ohtani ball four and first base. You could hear the disappointment in the groans from A’s and Ohtani fans alike. It was a sad, boring — and judging from the boos, irritating — way to end the night for the game’s greatest player.","pitch,york,fans,wild,game,plate,poetry,batter,times,baseball,lost,pitcher,ohtani,clock",0.37052,-0.07272,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/autossell/05Nathan-Cover/05Nathan-Cover-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/autossell/05Nathan-Cover/05Nathan-Cover-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/05/autossell/05Nathan-Cover/05Nathan-Cover-square640.jpg'}"

You were re-upping your immune response and diversifying your immunological tools — potentially multiple times a year, a kind of natural booster.

But there is also a very basic difference between a disease like Covid and a disease like measles or chickenpox.
It doesn’t really even start replicating until it gets that deep into the body.","Yeah — what is going on?

We used to think we just had this spectacular immune response when we first encountered the virus at, say, age 6, and that the immune response lasted until we were 70. But actually what we were seeing was the effect of an immune system being retrained every time it came into contact with the virus after the initial infection — at 6, and 7, and 8, and so on. Every time your friend got chickenpox, or your neighbor, you got a massive boost. You were re-upping your immune response and diversifying your immunological tools — potentially multiple times a year, a kind of natural booster.

But now, in America, kids get chickenpox vaccines. So you don’t have kids in America getting chickenpox today, and never will. But that means that older Americans, who did get it as kids, are not being exposed again — certainly not multiple times each year. And it turns out that, in the absence of routine re-exposures, that first exposure alone isn’t nearly as good at driving lifelong immunity and warding off shingles until you immune system begins to fall apart in old age — it can last until you’re in your 30s, for example but not until your 70s.

There’s a similar story with measles. There is no routine later-life sequelae, like shingles, for measles. But what we do see is that, in measles outbreaks today, there are some people who were vaccinated who get it anyway. Maybe 5 to 15 percent of cases are not immunologically naïve people, but vaccinated people. So — what’s up with that? We thought we had lifelong protection from childhood vaccination, but because there’s no more natural boosting of measles anymore, that protection wanes to some degree over time.

But to think about that in the context of Covid, for a minute — all of those subsequent exposures to chickenpox were basically invisible. You didn’t get sick the second or fifth or ninth time you encountered the virus. Covid is still making some people sick, on reinfection, if typically less sick.

And with Covid, we’re getting infected frequently. But there is also a very basic difference between a disease like Covid and a disease like measles or chickenpox. For measles or chickenpox to cause a symptomatic infection, it has to be brought into the body, through the upper respiratory tract and the lungs, into the bloodstream and the lymph. It doesn’t really even start replicating until it gets that deep into the body. And if it doesn’t get that deep, it doesn’t replicate. With a disease like that, our T-cells and B-cells, which were created during past exposure or by vaccination, typically stop the virus early enough that no replication happens and we don’t even notice it.","measles,known,response,kids,immune,doesnt,start,opinion,disease,chickenpox,covid,virus,vaccination",0.25370,0.00194,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/opinion/04wallace-wells-image/04wallace-wells-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/opinion/04wallace-wells-image/04wallace-wells-image-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/opinion/04wallace-wells-image/04wallace-wells-image-facebookJumbo.jpg'}"

Prosecutors and defense lawyers said in court that they had not held any negotiations over a plea agreement, and that no deal had ever been offered to Mr. Bankman-Fried.","acted,crypto,bankmanfrieds,trial,bankmanfried,lied,ftx,writings,pleaded,guilty,fraud,worldmr,sam,mr,opens,world,faith,good",0.28449,-0.04491,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/multimedia/04sbf-openings-parents-cmwh/04sbf-openings-parents-cmwh-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/23/reader-center/author-j-edward-moreno/author-j-edward-moreno-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/multimedia/04sbf-openings-parents-cmwh/cmwh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/multimedia/author-matthew-goldstein/author-matthew-goldstein-thumbLarge.png', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/04/multimedia/04sbf-openings-parents-cmwh/04sbf-openings-parents-cmwh-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/25/reader-center/author-david-yaffe-bellany/author-david-yaffe-bellany-thumbLarge.png'}"

The popularity of social-media video and podcasts has led to a variety of affordable microphones, software and other tools for creating better-quality audio for personal projects. Even if you don’t plan to start a podcast, understanding digital audio a bit more can make other tasks like recording Grandma’s stories for a family-history archive or adding a narration track to your vacation videos sound much cleaner.

Here’s an overview.

Hardware

Just about every laptop includes a microphone for videoconferencing and audio calls, but the fidelity can be lacking. An external microphone that plugs into your computer’s USB port gives you much better sound quality. Logitech’s Yeti ($130) and the Shure MV5 ($99) are two models recommended by Wirecutter, the product review site owned by The New York Times. (Setup is usually simple, but if you plug in the mic and nothing happens, make sure the new hardware is selected in the computer’s sound input settings.)

Recording on a smartphone is standard for social-media video and audio. The phone’s own headset microphone and earphones may work in some situations. If you need an external mic, say, to clip to an interview subject’s shirt, you have options. RØDE makes phone-friendly external microphones, and Amazon sells a wide variety from different companies, most for less than $100. (Given the ever-changing ports on smartphones these days, make sure the mic you like will connect to your phone properly.)","video,audio,sound,better,external,yeti,variety,sure,usb,projects,microphone,mic",0.31192,0.09386,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/27/technology/personaltech/27TECHTIP-TOPART/27TECHTIP-TOPART-facebookJumbo.jpg,"{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/27/technology/personaltech/27TECHTIP-TOPART/27TECHTIP-TOPART-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/27/technology/personaltech/27TECHTIP-TOPART/27TECHTIP-TOPART-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/multimedia/author-j-d-biersdorfer/author-j-d-biersdorfer-thumbLarge.png'}"

The experience of socializing with others while playing games reminded me of the LAN (local area network) parties of the 1990s, when gamers carried bulky computers to one another’s homes to play together. It was a type of social gathering that feels antiquated now that internet speeds are zippy enough for us to play games online from our own homes.

Some mixed-reality app developers I later interviewed offered more clarity than Meta about the benefits of the technology.

Developers there said that being able to see into the real world while juggling virtual tasks would make the experience less jarring for professionals to wear headsets while working alongside colleagues in an office.

The trial raises questions about how and why we use Google search. Many of us grew up doing web searches on Google because it seemed to deliver the best results with minimal effort. But if something better came along, would we really have known since Google came loaded on most of our devices? And even if we had known, would we have just stuck with Google since its search engine was set as the default?

I decided to test how easy or hard it really is to switch to a different search engine. In a blog post this month, Google said the change was a straightforward process and offered three examples:

On an iPhone, it takes four taps.

On a Mac’s Safari browser, it takes two clicks.

On Android phones, it takes two taps.

So I followed Google’s instructions and also shared the company’s guidance with a panel of three design veterans. The verdict: It’s hard to switch — and most people would probably give up before completing the change.

“God help me, I’m dead,” Ted Selker, a product design veteran who worked at IBM and Xerox PARC, said after reading the steps to change the search engine on an iPhone.
